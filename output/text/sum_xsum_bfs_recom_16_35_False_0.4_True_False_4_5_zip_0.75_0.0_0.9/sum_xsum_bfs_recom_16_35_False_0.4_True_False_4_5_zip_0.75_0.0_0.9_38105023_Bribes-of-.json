militant group al-Shabab, which is affiliated to al-Qaeda.\nGen Nur told the BBC Somali Service that some seats should be re-run because money had been used to \"out-manoeuvre\" other candidates, in some cases, meaning all but one candidate had withdrawn.\nCases of government resources being used in the election have also been documented, he said.\nThe elections are being funded by the United Nations which also supports the government based in the capital, Mogadishu.\nSomalia has not had a functional national government since the ousting of its former leader Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991.",
