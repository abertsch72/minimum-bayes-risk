{"src": "He returned to his home town of Middlesbrough for the ceremony, in which he was made an honorary doctor in professional achievement.\nMr Mortimer paid tribute to the area for its \"distinctive, dry, sense of humour\".\nMany of the characters created in his double act with Vic Reeves were based on locals, he revealed.\nHe said:  \"I was here until I was 25, and the people that you meet then remain with you a lot longer than people you meet when you are older.\n\"It always makes me sad when I come home, in that nice way, as I have so many fond memories of the place.\"\nWhen asked if he thought Middlesbrough FC would win promotion back to the Premier League, he said he would not curse them with a prediction.\nAs for his doctorate, he said: \"I will frame it and put it
