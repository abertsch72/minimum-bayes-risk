It's just been such a crazy, incredible four years.\"\nBeighton, who lost both legs while serving in the Army in Afghanistan in 2009, rowed at the London Paralympics while Wiggs, who was left paralysed overnight while on a gap year in Australia, aged 18, was part of the sitting volleyball squad.\nMarsden is a former world champion powerlifter, while Oliver broke his leg playing football in 2008 and had his leg amputated after 17 operations.\nGreat Britain is one of only two countries, along with Australia, to have qualified places in all six Paralympic events.\nSquad: Nick Beighton
