{"src": "Lawyers for the 15-year-old have also begun proceedings against Google and Twitter.\nThe lawsuit centres on publicity surrounding his arrest last month by police probing a major hack into the phone and broadband provider's website.\nDetails of the case emerged after some reporting restrictions were lifted.\nThe three newspapers defending the action - The Daily Telegraph, The Daily Mail and The Sun - all gave undertakings to protect the boy's identity pending the outcome of the case.\nThe judge at the High Court in Belfast also granted injunctions against Google and Twitter in a bid to remove any online references to the teenager's name and address, and images or information about his physical appearance.\nThe boy was among four people to be detained in connection with the TalkTalk hacking probe.\nHe was interviewed on suspicion of offences under the Computer Misuse Act before being released on bail.\nSince then, his lawyers have issued writs claiming negligence, misuse of private information, defamation, breach of confidence and data protection.\nAs part of their action, they took legal steps to secure the removal of material published about the boy and where he lived.\nThe court heard that his family has had to move home after the publicity around his arrest.\nIt was claimed that he could be identified from newspaper articles and photographs that appeared at the time.\nA barrister for the boy said the content contributed to his client being \"stigmatised\" within his community.\nHe said the teenager's name also featured in tweets and online searches.\nDuring one of a number of hearings in the case, a lawyer for the Daily Mail rejected claims that it had revealed his identity.\nShe said the newspaper altered the boy's appearance and changed his hair colour in the photo it used.\nShe said his name and address had not been published, and added: \"It's our client's view that they did not identify the plaintiff.\"\nA temporary ban on reporting on the application for an injunction was imposed over fears that it could trigger further internet searches.\nBut after steps by Google and Twitter to remove the information, reporting restrictions were relaxed.\nAn order prohibiting the publication of any material that could lead to the boy being identified remains in place.\nThe case is due to be heard again next month.", "tgt":
