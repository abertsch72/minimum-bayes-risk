{"src": "Cleveland Potash, which runs the site near Saltburn, said the development would secure the plant for 40 years.\nPlans include extending the mine to the east and upgrading facilities to increase production capacity.\nSome groups have raised concerns the development could have an intrusive effect on the local area.\nThe company hopes to extend its planning permission with the North York Moors National Park Authority to 2063.\nCleveland Potash's parent company Israel Chemicals Ltd (ICL) is set to invest \u00c2\u00a3300m in the area over the next five years.\nAs well as funding the development of the Boulby site, the investment will go towards upgrading the company's Teesport operation near Middlesbrough, which exports potash mined at Boulby.\nOne of the first steps will be the \u00c2\u00a316m replacement of the tower at the top of the Boulby site's rock shaft, which lifts the mineral up from the mine.\nThe renewal will raise the amount of ore lifted to around 5.3 million tonnes a year, a one million tonne increase on the current maximum.\nThe mine's underground equipment, which Cleveland Potash general manager Phil Baines described as \"aged\", will also be modernised.\nMr Baines said: \"Our present combination of potash resources and reserves totals around 70 million to 80 million tonnes, but following a major exploration programme we expect this figure will increase significantly over the new few years.\n\"Our plan is to extend operations out to the east in parallel to the area worked over the past 40 years, effectively providing a new mine for the next 40 years.\"", "tgt": "Plans to extend a potash mine at Boulby in East Cleveland are expected to create more than 270 jobs by the end of 2015, the owners said.", "uid": "22152699", "oracle_20":
