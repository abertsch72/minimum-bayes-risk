{"src": "The Juno spacecraft passed over the giant storm on Monday as it continued with its series of close passes of the gaseous world.\nThe pictures of the spot reveal the intricate nature of its swirls which encompass a region bigger than Earth.\nJuno's instruments all acquired data during the pass which should now provide fresh insight on the storm.\nIt has been a particularly long-lived feature on Jupiter, but there is evidence that the 16,350-km-wide oval has actually been shrinking of late.\n\"For hundreds of years scientists have been observing, wondering and theorising about Jupiter's Great Red Spot,\"  Scott Bolton, Juno principal investigator from the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, said in a Nasa statement.\n\"Now we have the best pictures ever of this iconic storm. It will take us some time to analyse all the data from not only JunoCam, but Juno\u2019s eight science instruments, to shed some new light on the past, present and future of the Great Red Spot.\"\nScientists describe the storm as something similar to a hurricane - but there are significant differences between that kind of storm on Earth and what we see at Jupiter. Many behaviours are not the same.\nFor example, hurricanes on Earth quickly lose energy when they leave the ocean surface and pass over land - but on Jupiter, there is no land. Indeed, researchers are not even sure there exists any kind of hard surface under the planet's clouds.\nThis could be an explanation for why the spot has persisted for centuries. But Juno hopes to resolve such puzzles.\nIt has the instrumentation to determine the precise chemical composition of the oval's clouds, to sense their temperature and structure, and to measure how deep they go. There is a suspicion that the spot has very deep roots.\nJonathan Nichols, a British science team-member from the University of Leicester, marvelled at the new pictures.\n\"These images are stunning, and reveal Jupiter's Great Red Spot in all its glory,\" he told BBC News.\n\"From the three swirls inside the deep red core to the waves and vortices orbiting it, the images reveal the power and chaos of this iconic storm.\n\"The light and dark shades reveal the wind flow in the spot and potentially the 3D structure of the cloud decks.  But the images are also a perfect convergence of science and art, revealing the awesome beauty of the giant planet.\n\"The quality of these data are superb, and it bodes well for further Juno data that will reveal how deep into the atmosphere the Great Red Spot extends.\"\nJuno has been at Jupiter for just over a year. It flies large ellipses around the planet, coming in close every 53 days.\nMonday\u2019s pass saw it skim just 3,500km above the cloudtops at one point. When it travelled across the spot, it was still a mere 9,000km overhead.\nThe practice of the mission so far has been to release raw images from JunoCam and invite the public to work on them - to process them in ways that highlight areas of scientific interest, or simply to make some fascinating artwork.\nMeanwhile, the science team gets to work on the data-sets from the other instruments. Their findings take a while longer to emerge - at conferences and in journal papers.\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos", "tgt": "An American space agency probe has returned the most detailed pictures ever of Jupiter's Great Red Spot.", "uid": "40594126", "oracle_20": [["An American space agency's (Nasa) has returned the most detailed pictures ever of Jupiter's Great Red Spot.", 24, {"rouge2": 0.8571428571428571}], ["An American space agency has captured the most detailed pictures ever of Jupiter's Great Red Spot.", 19, {"rouge2": 0.787878787878788}], ["An American space agency has taken the most detailed pictures ever of Jupiter's Great Red Spot.", 19, {"rouge2": 0.787878787878788}], ["An American space agency (Nasa) has acquired the most detailed pictures ever of Jupiter's Great Red Spot.", 23, {"rouge2": 0.7647058823529412}], ["An American space agency has sent back the most detailed pictures ever of Jupiter's \"Great Red Spot\"..", 22, {"rouge2": 0.7647058823529412}], ["An American space agency, Nasa, has obtained the most detailed pictures ever of Jupiter's Great Red Spot.", 22, {"rouge2": 0.7647058823529412}], ["An American space agency says it has returned some of the most detailed pictures ever of Jupiter's Great Red Spot.", 23, {"rouge2": 0.7567567567567567}], ["An American space agency says it has returned some of the most detailed pictures ever of Jupiter's \"Great Red Spot\"..", 25, {"rouge2": 0.7567567567567567}], ["An American space agency says it has captured the most detailed pictures ever of Jupiter's \"Great Red Spot\"..", 23, {"rouge2": 0.7428571428571428}], ["An American space agency's (Nasa) has released the most detailed pictures ever of Jupiter's \"Great Red Spot\".", 26, {"rouge2": 0.7428571428571428}], ["An American space agency, Nasa, has taken the most detailed pictures ever of Jupiter's Great Red Spot, taken.", 24, {"rouge2": 0.7428571428571428}], ["The US space agency says it has returned the most detailed pictures ever of Jupiter's Great Red Spot.", 21, {"rouge2": 0.7428571428571428}], ["An American space agency says it has acquired the most detailed pictures ever of Jupiter's \"Great Red Spot\"..", 23, {"rouge2": 0.7428571428571428}], ["An American space agency has taken some of the most detailed pictures ever of Jupiter's \"Great Red Spot\".", 23, {"rouge2": 0.7428571428571428}], ["An American space agency's (Nasa) has sent back the most detailed pictures ever of Jupiter's Great Red Spot.", 25, {"rouge2": 0.7222222222222222}], ["An American space agency says it has sent back the most detailed pictures ever of Jupiter's Great Red Spot.", 22, {"rouge2": 0.7222222222222222}], ["An American space agency has returned some of the most detailed pictures ever of Jupiter's famous Great Red Spot.", 22, {"rouge2": 0.7222222222222222}], ["A Nasa mission to Jupiter has returned the most detailed pictures ever of Jupiter's \"Great Red Spot\".", 22, {"rouge2": 0.7058823529411765}], ["An American space agency says it has captured some of the most detailed pictures ever of Jupiter's \"Great Red Spot\"..", 25, {"rouge2": 0.7027027027027027}], ["A US space agency has returned some of the most detailed pictures ever of Jupiter's Great Red Spot.", 21, {"rouge2": 0.6857142857142857}]], "oracle_1": [["An American space agency's (Nasa) has returned the most detailed pictures ever of Jupiter's Great Red Spot.", 24, {"rouge2": 0.8571428571428571}]], "sample": [["Nasa's latest space mission to Jupiter has taken what it says is the best ever pictures yet of the Great Red Spot on the planet Jupiter from a spacecraft as close as 1,000km.", 40, {"rouge2": 0.07843137254901962}], ["Nasa says it has obtained the best pictures ever of its Great Red Spot on the planet Jupiter from a spacecraft as close as 1,000km.", 31, {"rouge2": 0.19047619047619052}], ["Nasa's latest mission to Jupiter has taken what it says is the best ever pictures of Jupiter's Great Red Spot, which has been a feature of astronomers' attention for centuries.", 37, {"rouge2": 0.20833333333333331}], ["An American space agency (Nasa) has sent back the best ever images of the Great Red Spot on Jupiter since it began orbiting.", 28, {"rouge2": 0.25641025641025644}], ["An American space agency says it has taken its best pictures of the Great Red Spot on Jupiter in more than a century.", 25, {"rouge2": 0.25641025641025644}], ["A Nasa spacecraft has returned the best ever picture of Jupiter's Great Red Spot -
