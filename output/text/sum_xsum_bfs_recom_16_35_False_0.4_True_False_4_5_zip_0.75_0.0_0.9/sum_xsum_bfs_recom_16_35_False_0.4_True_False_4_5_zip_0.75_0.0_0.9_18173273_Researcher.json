{"src": "Researchers from Boston Children's Hospital in Massachusetts found a doubling in the odds of obesity by the time the child was three years old.\nThe team said birth by C-section might affect bacteria in the gut, which in turn affects the way food is digested.\nThe study looked at 1,255 pairs of mothers and children from 1999 to 2002.\nThe mothers joined the study - published in the Archives of Disease in Childhood - before 22 weeks of pregnancy.\nTheir babies were measured and weighed at birth and this was repeated at the age of three.\nAbout one in four of the deliveries were C-section births and the remainder were vaginal deliveries.\nThe team found a link between body mass, skin thickness and how a child was born.\nThey also found that mothers who delivered by C-section tended to weigh more than those delivering traditionally - something which is known to influence obesity.\nBut the researchers said another possible explanation was the difference in the composition of gut bacteria acquired at birth between the two delivery methods.\nThey suggested expectant mothers who choose a C-section should be made aware of the obesity risk to their babies.\nIn the UK just over 23% of births are Caesarean.\nPatrick O'Brien, a spokesman for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said: \"This is an interesting study, but small. It needs to be replicated in a bigger sample.\"", "tgt": "Babies who are delivered through Caesarean section are twice as likely to become obese than those born traditionally, US research suggests.",
