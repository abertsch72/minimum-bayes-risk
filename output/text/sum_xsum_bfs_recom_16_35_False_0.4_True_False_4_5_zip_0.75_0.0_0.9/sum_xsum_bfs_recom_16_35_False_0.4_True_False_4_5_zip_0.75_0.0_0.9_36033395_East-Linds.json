{"src": "East Lindsey council introduced charges at 13 sites in 2013 in a bid to offset government funding cuts.\nThe authority is now consulting on the introduction of an overnight parking charge across all its managed sites.\nDeputy leader Graham Marsh said free parking was re-instated after feedback from businesses and the public.\nMore on this and other local stories in Lincolnshire\nHe said: \"I can see the logic for it [charging] - trying to get a consistent strategy across the district - but it didn't work and different areas have different needs.\"\nMr Marsh said it was hoped the changes would be a permanent measure.\nThe council announced in December it was considering a \u00c2\u00a32 overnight parking charge on all paid car parks in the district, but this is yet to be implemented.\nMr Marsh added: \"We need to assess what impact it will have, and realistically will it raise sufficient money for what it costs?\"\nThe authority is currently trying to make savings of \u00c2\u00a36m by 2019/20.", "tgt": "Free all-day car parking has been re-instated at 10 sites in Lincolnshire, three years after it was scrapped to save money.", "uid": "36033395", "oracle_20":
