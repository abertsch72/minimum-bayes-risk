Crews also failed to get approval before deviating from their route and failed to report the engine failure that led to their capture.\nThey were within sight of Iran's Farsi Island, which also serves as an Iranian speedboat base, but believed it to be Saudi territory.\nThe sailors, who were held for 15 hours on Farsi Island, were also criticised for their behaviour during about 15 hours in Iranian captivity.\nOne sailor made \"statements adverse to US interests\" and another encouraged fellow crewmembers to eat food offered to them while being recorded on video, which could be used for propaganda purposes.\nSeven were interrogated - \"some were honest, while others lied or played dumb,\" the report said.\nNone were harmed, but Iranian interrogators \"employed intimidation tactics such as slapping the table, spinning the captive's chair, or threatening to move them to the Iranian mainland\".\nDespite the errors, the US Navy also insisted its boats \"had every right\" to be where they were and said Iran had \"violated international law as well as US sovereign immunity\" by boarding and seizing them.", "tgt": "Weak leadership, poor judgment and a lack of \"warfighting
