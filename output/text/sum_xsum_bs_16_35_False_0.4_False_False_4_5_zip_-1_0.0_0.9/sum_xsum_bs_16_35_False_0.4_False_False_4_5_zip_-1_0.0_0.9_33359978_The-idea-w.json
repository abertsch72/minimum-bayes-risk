{"src": "The idea was discussed at a meeting between Justice Minister Caroline Dineage and parents who failed to receive the ashes of their dead babies.\nIt followed an inquiry into failings at Shrewsbury crematorium.\nGlen Perkins, who formed the Action for Ashes campaign group, said Mrs Dineage had proposed a national consultation.\nIt is expected to include affected families throughout England and Wales as well as industry experts.\nMr Perkins - whose daughter Olivia died from sudden infant death syndrome in 2007 - described the meeting as \"very positive\" and said there was a willingness by the government to resolve the matter \"sooner rather than later\".\nHe was joined in Westminster by parents from Leicester, Hull, Banbury and Stoke-on-Trent.\nThey handed in a 61,000-signature petition calling for the return of ashes to be a legal requirement.\nFamilies were accompanied by Daniel Kawczynski, MP for Shrewsbury, who has secured a parliamentary debate on the issue on Wednesday.\nIn a statement, Mrs Dineage said: \"Having heard the experiences of some of the families affected, it is clear we must do all we can to make sure this never happens again.\n\"No parent should have their grief compounded by a system that is supposed to help. The Emstrey report had a number of recommendations and it is imperative that we consider each one carefully.\"\nLast month, David Jenkins, who led the independent inquiry into failings in Shrewsbury, said he had been \"struck by the absence of authoritative national guidance\".\nHe proposed the creation of a national inspector of crematoriums.\nAbout 60 families are believed to have been affected by failures at Shrewsbury's Emstrey crematorium between 1996 and 2012.\nSpeaking at the time, Mr Jenkins said there was clearly \"no more painful experience\" than losing a child and that the issue of infant cremation should be treated as of \"the utmost importance\".\nA Freedom of Information inquiry by the BBC last year found the ashes of more than 1,000 babies were not handed to their parents between 2008 and 2013.\nIn March, former Justice Minister Simon Hughes had suggested new national guidelines could be brought in by the end of the year.\nThere was a real sense of positivity from the families that made the trip to London - a feeling they had done all they could to raise this issue.\nNow they are keeping a close eye on what happens next.\nI understand a consultation could start very soon and families are already being asked to register their details with the Ministry of Justice.\nEmotions were high when the campaigners handed in their petition. Five families carried boxes full to the brim with signatures.\nGlen Perkins, whose daughter Olivia died in 2007, was in tears on the steps of Number 10 Downing Street and that sums up the journey he and other families have been on.\nOther families put their arms around him as they posed for photos and then knocked on the door to hand in their petition.\nOf course it won't bring their child back and in many cases they will never know what happened to their ashes, but I think they do feel what they've done today has left a bit of a legacy in their child's name.", "tgt": "A consultation about
