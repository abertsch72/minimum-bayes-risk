# [Massive-scale Decoding for Text Generation using Lattices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.07660)
[Jiacheng Xu](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~jcxu/), [Greg Durrett](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~gdurrett/)

TL;DR: a new search algorithm to construct lattices encoding many generation options; 
two key technical contribution: (1) best-first search, (2) path recombination.



## Visualization
We provide a few examples at vis folder. You need to download the html files to view and **intereact** with the model outputs.
The completed set of outputs are available at [Box](https://utexas.box.com/s/wmvhg8lol3kvgirizqyiyiblbn6ogj1a).

## Getting started
Under construction.
